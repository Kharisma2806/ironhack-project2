          <p>
             Nearly a third of all food produced each year is squandered or lost before it can be consumed.
             In many developed countries, food waste happens in the kitchen — when we prepare foods that go uneaten, or leave food to
             spoil in fridges and kitchen cabinets.

            <p> Eliminating global food waste would save 4.4 million tonnes of C02 a year, the equivalent of taking one in four cars off
                the road.
                Reducing food waste is the 3rd most effective way to address climate change</p>
